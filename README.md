# Project: armdocs-selection-process
This project contains the 3 problems presented on armdocs selection process. In a real world project we would separate then in 3 projects, but to keep it simple, here they are on the same project.

## Problem 1
The solution to this problem is on the code in question1 package.
There's a main method on the class Main.java that creates a simple network like on the problem description and prints it.
The class NetworkTest contains the JUNit tests to the Network class, which centralizes the network operations.

## Problem 2
The solution to this problem is on the code in question2 package.
There's a main method on the class Main.java that reads input from the inputQuestion2.txt file in the format provided by the problem description.

## Problem 3
The solution to this problem is on the code in question3 package.
There's a main method on the class Main.java that reads input from the inputQuestion2.txt file in the format provided by the problem description.
